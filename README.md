# AI-Powered YouTube Video Insights with Streamlit, LangChain, and OpenAI

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models to extract and analyze insights from YouTube video transcripts. Users can input a YouTube video URL along with a query, and the application will generate a detailed response based on the video's content. The application uses FAISS for efficient similarity search across transcript chunks, making it easy to find the most relevant information in response to user queries.

## Key Features
- **Streamlit UI**: Simple and intuitive interface for user interaction.
- **YouTube Transcript Extraction**: Fetches and processes video transcripts for analysis.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the language of user queries to tailor responses accordingly.
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain for document management, text splitting, and interaction with the LLM.
- **FAISS Vector Store**: Efficiently searches and retrieves relevant transcript chunks using FAISS.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Generates insightful responses based on the transcript and user query.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file.
4. Run the Streamlit application to start analyzing YouTube videos!
